# House Accomodation üè†
_Kotlin program designed to check accommodation for various housing/hotel options (first ever repo)_
<br />

<br />
Welcome to my first ever GitHub repository. The code you find here is self-written (well, kinda.. more about that later) from scratch using Kotlin language.
Kotlin is an amazing programming language to code with, and a must-have tool in your modern android development toolset.

I have written this code, as part of my ongoing Android Development learning journey. I am following Google's Kotlin Android Development pathway, which contains many codelabs, including the one that teaches you to write a complete Kotlin program from scratch, as you see in this repo. 
This specific codelab teaches you Kotlin Programming while covering the Object Oriented Programming concepts, such as inheritance, classes and objects etc. 
You can check out the pathway here: https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course

This is just a beginning of my journey. Many more amaizng things to come. 
Feel free to leave any sort of feedback on this code, or even use this code to your needs. 
You can get in touch with me at themonkwhocodes@gmail.com

_Note_:  This code is not copied, but written from scratch after following the lessons from Google's codelabs. Hence credit goes to Google for inspiring the code that I wrote in this repo.
